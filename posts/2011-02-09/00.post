<blockquote>
IEFBR14 is an IBM mainframe utility program. It runs in all IBM mainframe environments derived from OS/360, including z/OS. It is a placeholder whose purpose is to do nothing. As it turned out, over the years, it would have problems correctly doing nothing and would sometimes fail in the task.
