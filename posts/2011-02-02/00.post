Microsoft, Fuck Yeah:
<blockquote>
<p>If you want your game to work in Germany BE VERY CAREFUL you never call float.Parse(string), you should call float.Parse(string, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture).
</p>
<p>Otherwise your parsing will screw up (in Germany they use ',' apparently) so something like 123.123 will become 123123.0.
</p>
<p>Microsoft QA will not pick up on this, the app will be pulled from the german store soon after its published.
