Your example is so pathetic; it shows you have not a clue.  You are an<br/>
utter idiot.  The eeepc is an exact manifistation of the problem<br/>
coming round again.  One year ago we had complete support of every<br/>
major component in every laptop, and then voila, this Linux-based<br/>
laptop came out which required a LINUX BLOB.  You are a clueless<br/>
fanboy.</blockquote>
